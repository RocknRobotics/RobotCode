Clean up network table code (add comments + organize the "folders" (everything treats every part of the swerve as being under the
laptop---values sent from the rio should be kept under the roborio "folder" instead of the laptop "folder")). Expand upon the drive
controller (add at least full/half/no speed button mappings, maybe more if I can remember what I was thinking earlier). Aiming to
get this done on Sunday. Will add commands for both Jetson/Laptop (autoInit, autoTele, etc.) and set it up so the Rio communicates
what they should be in/doing
