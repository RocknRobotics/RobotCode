The folders go in the robot folder, replace the build.gradle with the one in here. Gradle tasks for the jetson are setup for windows machine that is network sharing a directory with the path C:/OrinNano and a folder in it called 'Code'. I'll add the anacrontab commands and any shell scripts I used on the Jetson once I have my hands on it.
