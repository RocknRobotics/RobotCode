Timed Robot + swerve drive setup that plans to have communication between the roboRio, a Jetson Orin Nano, and a laptop (probably running windows).

Copy build.gradle and replace the default build.gradle file. Other folders go in the robot folder. There's still some things marked TODO (I think all it is is getting values like wheel diameter), so it won't work yet.
