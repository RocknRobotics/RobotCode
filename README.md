Timed Robot + swerve drive setup that plans to have communication between the roboRio, a Jetson Orin Nano, and a laptop (probably running windows).

Copy build.gradle and replace the default build.gradle file. Other folders go in the robot folder. There's still some things marked TODO (I think all it is is getting values like wheel diameter), so it won't work yet.

If you're contributing, then please create a branch with you name and stage changes via a pull request. Reviewer is for everyone who absolutely must approve your code before it gets pushed. Assignee is for anyone you want to look over your code/suggest changes. Reviewers may also suggest changes if they find it to be beneficial---but overly "nitpicky" suggestions should be kept to the assignees
