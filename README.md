Timed Robot + swerve drive setup that plans to have communication between the roboRio, a Jetson Orin Nano, and a laptop (probably running windows).

Copy build.gradle and replace the default build.gradle file. Other folders go in the robot folder. There's still some things marked TODO (I think all it is is getting values like wheel diameter), so it won't work yet.

Make sure to create a new branch and create a pull request when making changes. Reviewers are who you feel must review your code before the changes are accepted, and assignees are anyone you want to review your code before the changes are accepted, although they don't necessarily have to. The github should automatically assign the Rock N' Robotics account as a reviewer.
